Flappy bird clone game, made with RayLib library.

Using knowledge learned from GameDev.tv course "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners" as a refresher course after leaving university.

The point of doing this was to get myself back into programming after over 6 months out. 

This project is used by myself to tie in everything I learned from the course.

This project uses a VS Code workspace made by the GameDev.tv team and used throughout the course.
